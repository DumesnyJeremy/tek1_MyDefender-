## Module description
Graphical programming consists in creating images/animations and scenes management using algorithms and graphical resources.
The two prior axis "mathematics" and "game" are still to be, but a new UX/UI-oriented aspect emerges.

Once again, you can choose your first project among two.
Note that from now on, the projects will be to do in groups.

In the game axis is:
- MyDefender: Development of a tower defense game with an inventory and a skills tree.

Throughout the year, you will be provided the CSFML, a multimedia librairie developped in C.
